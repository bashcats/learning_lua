NAME
  lua - Lua interpreter

SYNOPSIS
  lua [ options ] [ script [ args ] ]

DESCRIPTION
  lua is the stand-alone Lua interpreter.  It 
loads and executes Lua programs, either in textual
source form or in precompiled binary form.
(Precompiled binaries are output by luac, the Lua
compiler.)  lua can be used as a batch interpreter
and also interactively.

Have you reproduced the classic hello world program?

When starting off with a new language it is usually

good practice to follow along a kind of interactive

tutorial although we also advocate for an exploratory

method of learning if you can be so self directed in

your study.



The first step to writing a lua program is of course..

-- Installing Lua:

On Debian/Ubuntu systems:
packages: lua5.1 lua5.2 lua5.3 lua5.4 are also available

sudo apt install lua

Or here is a terminal session from lua.org to build and
install the latest release from source code:

curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.6.tar.gz
tar zxf lua-5.4.6.tar.gz
cd lua-5.4.6
make all test
 
MacOS: If you have brew:
$ brew install lua

Otherwise you should really install from source code.
You can download the latest release from * lua.org *
which is distributed in an archive (lua-5.X.Y.tar.gz)
file to download and "unzip" with the tar zxf command.

Once you have downloaded and extracted the files you
should be left with a directory called lua-5.X.Y which
corresponds with the Lua version number of your choice

To build and install Lua in one step: make xxx install
..where xxx is your platform name eg: macosx or linux

$ cd lua-5.4.6

$ sudo make macosx install

..or to just build without installing:

$ make macosx

Linux users may try 'linux-readline' platform for more
line editing capabilities: apt install readline-dev

$ make linux-readline
$ sudo make install

If you got a permissions error you'll have to use sudo

Or install locally with "make local" which will create
a folder called install with the directory structure:

bin:
  lua luac
include:
  lua.h luaconf.h lualib.h lauxlib.h lua.hpp
lib:
  liblua.a
man/man1:
  lua.1 luac.1

So we see there are two executable files (programs)
included in the install. lua is the lua interpreter
luac is the lua compiler. To run the interpreter type
the following into your terminal:

$ cd install
$ ./bin/lua         # if you're using bash. (Linux)
$ bash bin/lua      # if you use zshell (MacOS users)


Execute the lua interpreter directly as above or
if installed properly the lua command should now
be available in your shell. Enter the following at
in your terminal:

$ lua

You should see some versioning and copyright info in
the header followed by your prompt: > _

Try entering an expression.  Type the equals sign
followed by some math expression at the prompt.
Or try joining some strings together!

> = 8*8

> = "hello w" .. tostring(3*2-6) .. "rld!"
hello w0rld!
> _


Welcome to Lua!
